    <h2>Why It Works</h2>
    <p>Most consultants spend hours a week writing and rewriting the same types of messages. A well-tuned GPT can draft these for you — with <strong>your tone, your values, and your clarity</strong>.</p>
    <p>This isn’t just automation. It’s a mirror of your communication style — optimized to save you time and earn trust.</p>
